# remixoji
A small app written with vanilla JavaScript to remix emoji expressions

## Live site
https://remixoji.netlify.app/

## Issues
There may be an issue with downloading remixed emojis on iOS since some iOS versions do not have a user facing file directory

## About
* This project is a rewrite of some older unstructured code I had written when I started re-learning JavaScript to catch up with modern standards
* It uses the ES6+ Classes and must be compiled with Babel to ensure compatibility with older browser versions
* This project is a lightweight example of MVC
* Webpack is used for babel translation and minification
* Node is used to compile the .pug template

## Build
``` npm run build ```
